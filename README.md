# 🚀 Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in C++

This repository contains clear and beginner-friendly examples of core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** concepts in **C++**. Each file demonstrates a specific OOP concept with real code examples to help you master C++ OOP fundamentals.

## 📂 File Structure & Concepts

### 1. [`intro.cpp`](intro.cpp) — **Introduction to OOPs**
> A quick overview of what Object-Oriented Programming is and why it's important in modern software development. Learn about the 4 pillars: **Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism**.

---

### 2. [`getter_and_setter.cpp`](getter_and_setter.cpp) — **Getters and Setters**
> Learn how to use **getter** and **setter** functions to access and modify private data members safely — a key part of encapsulation.

---

### 3. [`constructor.cpp`](constructor.cpp) — **Constructors**
> Understand constructors, their types (default, parameterized), and how they help in automatic object initialization.

---

### 4. [`shallow_copy.cpp`](shallow_copy.cpp) — **Shallow Copy**
> See how C++ copies object data **by reference**, leading to shared memory issues. Learn the risks of shallow copying.

---

### 5. [`deep_copy.cpp`](deep_copy.cpp) — **Deep Copy**
> Learn how to create a **deep copy** of objects to ensure independent copies in memory using custom copy constructors.

---

### 6. [`static.cpp`](static.cpp) — **Static Members and Functions**
> Understand how `static` variables/functions work inside classes. See how values are **shared** across all objects of a class.

---

### 7. [`encapsulation.cpp`](encapsulation.cpp) — **Encapsulation**
> Explore how encapsulation protects data by restricting access and exposing functionality through public methods.
